I am PhD student in Machine Learning working at the Division of Systems and Control at <a href='https://www.it.uu.se/'>Uppsala University</a>. In my research I focus on the intersection of Machine Learning and Optimization. My supervisors are <a href='https://jsjol.github.io/'>Jens Sjölund</a> (main) and <a href='https://www.kth.se/profile/ozan'>Ozan Öktem</a> from <a href='https://www.kth.se'>KTH</a> in Stockholm. My research is supported by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (<a href='https://wasp-sweden.org/'>WASP</a>) funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

I recieved a MSc in Computer Science from Uppsala University in 2022. Prior to that I revieved my undergraduate degree from the University of Passau, Germany in 2019.
