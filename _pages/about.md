I am a last year master student at Uppsala University majoring in Computer Science.
My studies focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Currently I am writing my master thesis about explainable product configuration for telecom products at the Cognitive Automation Lab at Ericsson Research (AI-MR).
I am also part-time employed at Uppsala University working as a Teaching Assistant for the Division of Systems and Control.
